# Makefile for ACN build directory
#
# This Makefile provides major configuration options. Most of the actual 
# rules are common to all build configurations and are in 
# ${ACNROOT}/build.make which is included here
#
##########################################################################
# ACNROOT is the route to the OpenACN top level directory (corresponding
# to openacn/trunk or whatever tag you have downloaded).

ACNROOT=..

##########################################################################
# PLATFORMNAME is the name of your platform.
# This is often the processor  architecture combined with the stack.
#
PLATFORMNAME:=h8300s-LWIP

##########################################################################
# BUILDDIR is the route to this build directory as reached from ACNROOT.
# You can use an absolute path:
# 
# BUILDDIR:=${shell pwd}
#
# or a relative one - which is shorter and works better on some systems
# (Note this must be a recursively expanded variable because ACNROOT varies
# with sub-makes):
#
BUILDDIR=${ACNROOT}/build-${PLATFORMNAME}

##########################################################################
# PLATFORM is the name of the direcory containing platform specific
# sources (network interface etc.). This is mostly defined and named by 
# the stack.
PLATFORM=platform/${PLATFORMNAME}

##########################################################################
# If you are corss compiling, you need to define yourC compiler here.
# If compiling is native, then it is usually best to leave this to Make.
#
CC=/usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/h8300-elf/gcc-bin/4.3.2/h8300-elf-gcc -ms

##########################################################################
# You may need to define the C preprocessor as well - not usually
# necessary for GCC because it can be accessed through CC, but other
# compilers are different.
#
# CPP:=${CC} -E

##########################################################################
# Need to access some LWIP stuff
#
LWIPDIR=${ACNROOT}/../lwip
INCLUDEDIRS+=${LWIPDIR}/src/include

export BUILDDIR CC

##########################################################################
# Include any more build specific configuration or rules here
#

##########################################################################
# Now include rules common to all builds
