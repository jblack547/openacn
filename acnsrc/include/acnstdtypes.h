  Type definitions for fixed size types in 8, 16, 32 bits and booleans.

  These are a subset of the ISO C99 types and should be kept to the
  standard.

  If USER_DEFINE_INTTYPES is set the user wants to define these
  themselves

  For ISO C99 compilers we just pull in inttypes.h and stdbool.h

  Otherwise we try and deduce them mostly from limits.h which is a C89
