/* 
   sdt_handler.h 
   Client protocol handler management for sdt
   In all functions "handlers" refers to the handler list. 
   If this is shared between threads we will need a locking mechanism.

   Client protocols can register handlers with:
   register_handlers(protocol,rx_handler,msg_handler, handlers) - 
       This registers callbacks for recieved packets and for sdt messages to the client protocol.
       Returns 0 if all is ok, returns -1 if handlers could not be allocated.
       TODO: more errors such as already registered protocol.

   deregister_handlers(protocol, handlers);
       removes the protocol from the handlers list. 

   get_rx_handler(protocol) - returns a pointer to the appropriate callback for protocol.
                              returns NULL if protocol is not registered.

   get_msg_handler(protocol) - returns a pointer to the message handler callback. 
                               returns NULL if not registered.

   init_handlers() - Creates and returns a new handler list.

   free_handlers(handlers) - Call on cleanup to free handlers memory.
