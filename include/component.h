  Local component structure is a rag-bag of information which represents
  a component within the local host. For efficiency, each layer can
  include it's own information within the component structure. because
  it is subject to many config options, other layers cannot rely on
  information outside their own scope and should leave it alone.

  Comonents must maintain their component structure in a fixed location
  as pointers to it may be stored and dereferenced at a later time.
