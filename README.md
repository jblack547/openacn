ANSI E1.17 2006 - Architecture for Control Networks (ACN) is a network architecture for control of stage equipment. 

OpenACN is designed to be customized for a wide range of platforms and uses. At present, there are no pre-built 
binaries, and no releases of source. To build ACN for your application you must check-out the source code, 
configure it for your particular application, then compile and install it.

The openACN licence places no obligation on you to make public any changes you make at all, however, if you find 
something which needs fixing and work out how to fix it, then it builds the strength and reliability, not just of 
your own products, but of those yours will connect to if you report back what you have done. 

ACN is an interoperability standard and if the equipment you connect to has bugs, there is no guarantee that the 
service calls will go to them and not to you!
