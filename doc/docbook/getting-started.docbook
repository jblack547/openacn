>OpenACN is designed to be customized for a wide range of platforms and uses. At present, there are no pre-built binaries, and no releases of source. There is just source code maintained in a version controlled repository using <ulink
url="???"
>Subversion</ulink
>, a popular open source version control application. To build ACN for your application you must check-out the source code, configure it for your particular application, then compile and install it.</para

>First you need a Subversion client (see <ulink
url="http://subversion.tigris.org/"
>Subversion</ulink
>). Once this is intalled OK you should navigate in a suitable command line shell to the place you want to built openACN. You then <emphasis
>checkout</emphasis
> the source code using the subversion command - <quote
>svn</quote
>. If all works properly, Subversion will download all sources and install them into a new openacn directory.</para

><para
>The openACN licence places no obligation on you to make public any changes you make at all, however, if you find something which needs fixing and work out how to fix it, then it builds the strength and reliability, not just of your own products, but of those yours will connect to if you report back what you have done. ACN is an interoperability standard and if the equipment you connect to has bugs, there is no guarantee that the service calls will go to them and not to you!</para
><para
>The best way to report your changes, is to submit a patch generated using the <emphasis
>diff</emphasis
> command. If you cannot do this, then please send a simple report of what you have found to the development mailing list.</para
